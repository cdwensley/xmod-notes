\subsection{Semidirect Products} \label{subs:sdp}

We include here some basic results on semidirect products
which will be needed in later sections.

\begin{prop}\quad\\
\vspace{-3mm}
\begin{enumerate}[{\rm (a)}]
\item
If a set  $X$  has a right  $G$-action  $x \mapsto x^g$
then $X$ has an associated left $G$-action:
$$
{}^g\!x \quad := \quad x^{g^{-1}}~.
$$
\item
The semidirect products  $R \ltimes S$  and  $S \rtimes R$
have multiplication rules
\begin{eqnarray*}
(r,s)(q,t)  & = &  (rq,\,s^q\,t) \quad\mbox{in}\quad R \ltimes S~, \\
(s,r)(t,q)  & = &  (s\,{}^r\!t,\,rq) \quad\mbox{in}\quad S \rtimes R~.
\end{eqnarray*}
\item
There is an isomorphism between these two groups:
$$
\psi \;:\; R \ltimes S \to S \rtimes R\,,
\quad (r,s) \mapsto (\,{}^r\!s,\,r)~,
$$
with inverse
$$
\psi^{-1} \;:\; S \rtimes R \to R \ltimes S\,,
\quad (s,r) \mapsto (r,\,s^r)~.
$$
\end{enumerate}
\end{prop}
