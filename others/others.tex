\section{Other types of Crossed Module}

Ellis, in \cite{ellis-thesis}, defined crossed modules, cat$^1$-groups, 
and associated structures in \emph{categories of $\Omega$-groups} which, 
as well as including ordinary groups, includes associativew algebra 
and Lie algebras. 
In this section we describe the constructions in these two particular cases.
